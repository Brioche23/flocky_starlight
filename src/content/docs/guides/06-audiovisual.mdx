## Voiceover Script

RunChallenge is not just a running club,
we aim to bring people together, one step at a time,
your ability doesn’t matter, you just have to show up and give it your all.

Run Challenge is an act of solidarity.
And the Flocky system is here to enhance this.

The app allows the coach to keep track of the workouts.

The smart bracelet is designed for running in groups.
With a simple sync, everyone in the team is connected.

Flocky provides an easy way to check if every runner is within reach,
making running safer and less stressful for everybody.

Not only that.
Thanks to anonymous biometrics data,
the training team always knows how the training is going,
adjusting the exercises to match the group’s fatigue.

But what happens if someone is left behind?

Flocky notices,
and instantly alerts the trainer and the team.
Because together, we're stronger.

Trainers and volunteers don't just lead;
they inspire a community.
A community that has spread to other cities.
We aim to connect those cities as we connect the runners.

Where we bring people together, one step at a time.

Flocky, Never Left Behind
