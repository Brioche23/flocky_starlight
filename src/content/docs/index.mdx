    This project explores a new way to enhance the running experience using a natural interaction. Running in groups can be stressful for trainers and runners, especially when the training is performed in difficult conditions, such as very crowded cities or parks after sunset. For a trainer can be difficult to make sure that everyone stays within the group.

    Flocky is a phygital system made to bring an additional element of safety and control during group running sessions, both for Runners and for Trainers. It makes it possible to track the position and the status of every runner in a group.

    Thanks to this system Runners and Trainers can focus more on the act of running and socializing during the training sessions. The data gathered can be used by associations to promote themselves by validating their activity.

_The Flocky team at RunChallenge, ready to run_

For the development of this project, we worked within the context of RunChallenge, an inclusive running club with branches all over Italy. They organize running sessions for people with every kind of ability, going from a slow walk to an actual professional jog.

People meet at the sports center, divide into groups, and then walk to the nearest park, where the training begins. Each group has one trainer, some volunteers, and the runners.

RunChallenge is not only a training club, but a real and intimate community. For them, running is not only about physical performance, but is mostly a way to connect with others, socialize, and make people feel better about themselves.

 <Card title="The Problem" icon="error">
 RunChallenge already works well with people, making sure that no matter what one’s ability is, there will always be a way for them to take part in the training. Inclusivity is key.

By running with them, we noticed however that the running session was constantly interrupted by the “Spoon moments” (Cucchiaio), in which the trainer gathered everyone and made a U-turn, to gather the people that were left too much behind. To make sure that no one gets lost, every group needs multiple volunteers to constantly check where every runner is.

By interviewing Davide Lovino, a trainer and one of the RunChallenge creators, we understood that this might not be enough to grant that no one is left behind, especially when running in the dark or in the case of smaller RunChallenge branches, that might not have enough volunteer to monitor the whole group.

 <Card title="The Big Idea" icon="error">
Flocky is a phygital system made to add safety during the running session and give additional information to the trainer, all this while being almost fully unobtrusive for the runner.

The idea is to create a real-time tracking system of the group (the flock) that the trainer can use to conduct the running session better. Thanks to the bracelet network it is possible to track each runner’s proximity and heart rate so that if someone falls behind, both nearby runners and the trainer get immediately notified.

The data gathered can also be used to better plan each training according to the group effort and, on a higher level, they can be used to validate the association’s activity towards sponsors.
